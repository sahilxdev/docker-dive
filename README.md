# Docker Dive: Learn Docker with Fun!

#Work in Progress

Welcome to the **Docker Dive**, an interactive web-based game designed to help beginners learn Docker commands in a fun and engaging way. This project gamifies the Docker experience, visualizing container operations as animations involving a whale carrying containers on its back.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Console:** Type Docker commands to interact with the game.
- **Whale Animation:** Watch containers stack on a whale's back as you create and manage them.
- **Command Feedback:** See the results of your commands in real-time logs.
- **Learn Docker Basics:** Practice essential Docker commands like `run`, `ps`, `stop`, and `rm` in a simulated environment.
- **Fun Visuals:** Dynamic animations make learning enjoyable.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start the Game:**
   Launch the app and access the interactive console.

2. **Type Docker Commands:**
   - Example:
     - `docker run nginx` → Adds a new container labeled "nginx" to the whale's back.
     - `docker ps` → Zooms in on the whale, showing all running containers.
     - `docker stop nginx` → Dims the "nginx" container, marking it as stopped.
     - `docker rm nginx` → Removes the "nginx" container from the whale.

3. **Experiment and Learn:**
   Try different commands and watch how they affect the whale and its containers.
